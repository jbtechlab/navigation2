<!--
  This Behavior Tree replans the global path periodically at 1 Hz through an array of poses continuously
  with selecting the provided planner ids. In here example there 2 planner ids hence array of poses should consist
  of 2. It serves as an example of using multiple planner id in viapoint mode.
  and it also has recovery actions specific to planning / control as well as general system issues.
